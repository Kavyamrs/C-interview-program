1. Implement a circular queue,
write functions: read_queue(), write_queue(), clear_queue()
When the queue is full, write queue should overwrite oldest data.

2. Write a function to extract the payload from the given data and return the payload data in a new array to the calling function
Given below is the data format of the input
command = 2 bytes
Length = 2 bytes
Data type = 1 byte
Data =Length-1 bytes
Includes Data_type parameter
Ex:
input_array[] = {00, 02, 00, 11, 01, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10};
